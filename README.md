# TreasureHuntApplicationGameProject
An application to conduct treasure hunt events with editable puzzles where each puzzle is solved via scanning qr code and in the end call dialed to organizer.  
This application uses the Zbar library from GitHub for scanning the QR Codes that will be scattered in this treasure hunt and proceeding forward with the puzzles in the end reaching an activity where call can be placed for ending this hunt and storing the state of penultimate activity(Q10 lets say) in app for confirmation of the result. 
Also with shared preferences we are editing the puzzles dyamically and increasing the reusability of the application with proper admin authenticiation.

Recommended Additional Features that we are looking for:  

1. The code is yet to be optimized and standardized.  
2. Looking for much more interactive and interesting UI.  
3. Also adding image and video/audio puzzles instead of String puzzles using databases.  
4. Well Defined Proposal for adding a realtime Leaderboard feature to work on.
